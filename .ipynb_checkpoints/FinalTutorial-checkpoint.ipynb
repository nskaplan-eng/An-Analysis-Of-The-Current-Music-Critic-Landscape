    "# An Analysis Of The Current Music Critic Landscape\n",
    "by Nathan Kaplan\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of a music critic is to review notable music as it becomes released by the artist. Music fans tend to to use critic's reviews 1) to determine what to listen to and 2) as a centerpiece for discussing and debating music. As a result, a positive review can have a big effect on a band's commercial success. Over the past ten years bands like Death Grips, Brockhampton, Daughters, and Spellling have all been propelled to commercial success by positive reviews from critics. On the other side of the coin, negative reviews can be detrimental to a band's success. Pitchfork, a large music publication, infamously reviewed the 2006 album Shine On by Jet [by just embedding a video of a monkey peeing into its own mouth](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9464-shine-on/). The album did not sell well, and although it's impossible to measure, Jet undoubtably lost a significant number of fans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the role of music critics and the subjective nature of music reviewing, it is in the interest of fans and artists to know how different music publications review music differently. In this project, I will be analyzing the differences between several publication's top-songs-of-the-year lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The music critic landscape is incredibly varied, and each publication is known for having certain biases. Here is an overview of some of the major critic publications that we will be looking at in this tutorial:\n",
    "* The most popular music critic today seems to be Anthony Fantano, who has been releasing video reviews of new albums under his Youtube channel **The Needle Drop** since 2014 and has amassed over 2.5 million subscribers. Those who are critical of Fantano say that he is biased toward experimental music, and doesn't give certain well-liked albums a chance. Fantano's top-songs-of-the-year list are also only 50 songs long as opposed to the other publications which list 100.\n",
    "* One of the historically most popular music critic publications that still has a strong following today is the aforementioned **Pitchfork**. In contrast to Fantano, Pitchfork is made up of a team of music reviewers who release written music reviews. Pitchfork is critized for retroactively changing their reviews to correspond with public opinion. \n",
    "* The website rateyourmusic.com (abbreviated **RYM**), is a large forum for music fans to rate, review, and discuss music. This forum may also be viewed as a critic publication representing the views of music fans. The RYM ecosystem is critized for being overly-contrarian and rating small experimental songs over bigger well-liked ones. This may be exacerbated by the fact that people typically don't rate music that they don't listen to, and so well liked songs from extremely niche genres rise to the top. RYM is also different from the other publications in that their top-song-of-the-year list changes well after the year ends as people continue to use the website. \n",
    "* We can also view the general US public as a collective critic, who rates songs by listening to them more or less. In contrast to the music on RYM, the music listened to the most by the wider public is criticized for being overly-homogenous and inoffensive. The songs listened to the most by the US public are compiled by the organization **Billboard** every year. "

    "## Data collection/curation + parsing \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is collect and parse our data. We will be using the Spotipy library, which is a user-friendly python library to interact with the Spotify API and obtain audio features that have been pre-computed by Spotify. To get additional data about the artist, we will be crosslisting the Spotify data with a music database called MusicBrainz. The first step here is to import our libraries and connect to both Spotify and MusicBrainz. Spotify requires a public and secret developer key-- I store mine in a seperate text file but you can get your own by creating a developer account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/application).\n"

    "Note that there are a total of 15 songs that are missing from either Spotify or MusicBrainz. The list of these missing songs can be found [here](). Upon viewing this list of missing songs, it is clear that these songs are missing not at random. That is, the missingness of the songs are different from the general population of songs in a way that can't be explained by the data we have. In particular, these songs tend to be less-popular Trap or Experimental songs from RYM or Pitchfork. In the abscense of any data of the distribution of missing songs on Spotify, one method for imputing these songs would be to hand-pick other songs that share sonic characteristics with these songs, and impute them over several random trials. However, this would likely impart some of my bias on the selection of the songs. Therefore, for simplicity, we will accept some innacuracy and keep an eye on categories like popularity that we would expect to be effected. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are also missing several countries of origin and genders of artists from the MusicBrainz database. The best possible solution here would be to do seperate research for each missing entry (gender and country of origin is generally not too hard to find). Due to the volume of missing data and the time span of this project, I'm going to rule that out. If we considered this data missing at random (is MusicBrainz data collection random? Not clear), and had numbers for what proportion of musical artists are from each country and gender, we could again impute this data over several random trials. In the absence of this data, we will again just have to accept some inaccuracy and keep an eye on where the data might be skewed. "
